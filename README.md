# Clocked: A simple time-tracker

## Features

- JIRA Tempo export
- Task filtering by context/tag (work, gaming, project:abc)
- File-based
- Simple persistent commandline interface (stays active and works like Peco by
  filtering available tasks and switching to them when hitting ENTER)
- Integration with Restic to automatically trigger backups when a change is
  made.
